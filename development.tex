	\section{January 25, 2016}
	We are going to re-write SHREK starting from today. 
	There are a number of main goal in this re-work
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The whole parameter parsing 
		\item Better help messages
		\item Allow filtering by imputation score (0-1)
		\item Filtering of SNPs that have different reference/alternative allele with reference
		\item Use Armadillo instead of EIGEN to improve speed
		\item Filter \emph{all} SNPs that are in perfect LD
		\item Implement the advance variance calculation 
		\item Start documenting the codes
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Finished today}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Finished the error message for different modes
		\item Finished the parsing for binary trait
		\item Finished the parsing for quantitative trait
		\item Disabled risk prediction, should focus on the heritability estimation first
	\end{enumerate}
	\emph{I have not perform debugging, there can be error}
